# 45.Jump Game II

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
```





## Solution :

```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0 || nums.length == 1) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        int curCover = 0;
        int maxCover = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            maxCover = Math.max(nums[i] + i, maxCover);
            
          	// if maxCover bigger than nums.length-1, meaning we will arrive final point after next step.
            if (maxCover >= nums.length - 1) {
                count++;
                break;
            }
            
          	// if i=curCover, meaning we arrive the most far distance from last point, so we need to update
          	// the most far distance from next step.
            if (i == curCover) {
                curCover = maxCover;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
